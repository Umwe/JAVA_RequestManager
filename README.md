# JAVA_RequestManager
The RequestManager.java file is a utility class designed to manage and handle multiple concurrent requests safely using Javaâ€™s ExecutorService. The class ensures that incoming tasks (requests) are processed in separate threads without causing the system to freeze or crash. It also handles graceful shutdown and returns the results of each request.
